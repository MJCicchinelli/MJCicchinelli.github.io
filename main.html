								<strong>Howdy!</strong> My name is MJ Cicchinelli and I am a first-year graduate student working towards my Ph.D. at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln. 
								I earned both my Master's and Bachelor's degrees at the University of Delaware, graduating Cum Laude with a B.S. and a minor in Physics in 2024 and my M.S. in Mathematics in 2025, studying under Dr. Mokshay Madiman. 
								Prior, I graduated from the Downingtown Area School District in Pennsylvania in 2021.
							</p>
							<p>
								My research interests are broad, with primary focuses in algebra, geometry, topology, and their intersections. 
								I have also done prior work in post-quantum cryptography, category theory, and type theory. 
								For inquiries, please reach out through my personal email mariocicchinelli0@gmail.com.
							</p>
							<p>
								This website hosts a large number of resources related to me as a person, a mathematician, and as an instructor. 
								On the sidebar attached, you'll find links to my personal blog posts (centered around mathematics, for the most part), as well as resources I've prepared for both the Putnam Exam, as well as classes I've gotten to lead.
