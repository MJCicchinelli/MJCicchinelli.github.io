								Precalculus is in no way standardized across the United States. 
								The introduction of AP Precalculus in recent years attempts to rectify this, yet there is still wide disparity. 
								This new AP course covers much more than a standard undergraduate precalc course, yet still falls short of my (public) high school experience with the class.
							</p>
							<p>
								This may seem to be a non-issue, seeing as most students not preparing to enter a STEM field will never touch calculus, and those that do go into these higher math classes will have their knowledge disparities evened out during an undergrad calculus sequence. 
								It has however come to be that these differences in knowledge have become larger and larger in recent years. 
								Even further, students are coming into college calculus sequences after taking precalc at the same institution vastly under-prepared.
							</p>
							<p>
								I write this as someone who had the pleasure of teaching an online precalculus course during the University of Delaware's shortened winter semester. 
								Most of the students enrolled in the course had no intention of following through to calculus I, and were instead taking it solely to fulfill the university's requirement of completing a math course. 
								The course mirrored this, coming up far short of what should be expected of students entering calculus. 
								This is exemplified even now, as I teach a calculus II recitation section at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln. 
								As a key example, this winter precalc instructors were given about two and a half days (shy of four and a half in-class hours) to cover all of trigonometry. 
								Now, I have students who have never formally seen how to find a value for \( \theta \) when \( \sin(\theta) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).
							</p>
							<p>
								Students being under-prepared for calculus is by no means a new issue, but why has it not been better resolved? 
								After all, calculus I is very standardized across the U.S.: A discussion of limits followed by derivatives and their applications, then the semester wraps up with antiderivatives and integration. 
								Even most calculus II courses are fairly standardized discussing techniques and applications of integration, then switching gears into sequences and series to end with Taylor series.
							</p>
							<p>
								With all this in mind, precalculus needs to cover a <i>lot</i>> of material in order to prepare students for the actual calculus sequence. 
								However, it also needs to cover material for those students that won't go into calculus. 
								In combination, precalc must aim to develop strong mathematical thinking in the midst of giving students the tools they need to tackle calculus.
							</p>
							<p>
								As a sketch, I believe a strong precalculus should include rigorous treatment of the following topics with the intention of preparing students for calculus:
							<ol type="i">
								<li>Polynomials, their roots, and end behaviors;</li>
								<li>Exponentials and logarithms;</li>
								<li>Trigonometric functions and their relations;</li>
								<li>Sequences, series, and limits.</li>
							</ol>
							These are all necessary topics to cover for calculus, and the way they are taught can very much help improve student's mathematical critical thinking. 
							I think that this can be accomplished in a myriad of ways:
							<ol type="i">
								<li>Graphing (primarily, let's be honest);</li>
								<li>Introductory proofs and verifying equations;</li>
								<li>Questions pertaining to mathematical reasoning as opposed to mechanics.</li>
							</ol>
							</p>
							<p>
								Before my time, the high school precalculus class was not named as such. 
								It was instead `Mathematical Analysis'<a href="#foot1"><sup>1</sup></a> and I believe that the course I took reflected this. 
								I remember my time in the course as being much closer to a course in real analysis than a course in calculus, and I contribute quite a lot of my mathematical success to this course.
							</p>
							<p>
								I think this is why I am so passionate about how we teach precalc; It is the course that will set up students for the rest of their mathematical careers, and most of the time it falls far short of what it needs to be.
							</p>
							<p>
								So, with all of this in the open, I am beginning work in making materials for a strong precalculus course. 
								I intend to, with the help of other graduate students and educators, compile a complete backbone for the course, complete with guided notes, supplemental videos, and plenty of practice problems.
							</p>
							<p>
								The aim is for the course to completely free and accessible to all, with all the material uploaded to my webpage. 
								I hope that the material will service two main audiences:
							</p>
							<p>
								I want current educators to be able to use the material to improve their own precalc courses. 
								With all the material being provided, I hope that instructors can use everything to teach a stronger course that improves the way students build mathematical intuition.
							</p>
							<p>
								I also want it to be used by advanced students eager to learn more mathematics in a safe, rigorous space<a href="#foot2"><sup>2</sup></a>. 
								Often times, advanced students jump into fairly hard problems without a strong enough foundation and end up missing key insights for their mathematical intuition<a href="#foot3"><sup>3</sup></a>. It should also serve as solid reference material for students currently enrolled in calculus to look back on.
							</p>
							<p>
								I have a number of students now with shaky foundations in trigonometry or limits or polynomial division, and I would love a strong place to point to, yet I find a weak gap specifically here in online math education. 
								I hope for the work I have started to be done before the start of the 2026 fall semester, and I hope that this improves all students understanding of both precalculus and calculus.

							<p id="foot1"><sup>1</sup> The name changed for two reasons. The main being that schools across the country were standardizing the name 'Precalculus', the other can be guessed.</p>
							<p id="foot2"><sup>2</sup> I learned quite a bit of calculus in high school from watching videos on YouTube. This is where I built a fair bit of my problem solving intuition, yet I have yet to see something similar for precalculus.</p>
							<p id="foot3"><sup>3</sup> It may be worth it at some time to have a discussion about how advanced students are becoming more and more eager to take high level math classes sooner and sooner. While I applaud the excitement in higher mathematics, I have met (now many) high school students trying to jump into courses such as group theory without having a steady mathematical background.</p>
